Once you set out for Python
hope your debugging to be short,
full of adventures, full of knowledge.

Don't be afraid of the NaNs and the Nones,
the angry type exceptions
you'll never find them on your way
if you keep your testing high,
if rare excitement touches your spirit and your body.

You won't meet the NaNs and the Nones,
the wild type exceptions
unless you bring them along inside your soul,
unless your soul puts them in front of your screen.

Hope your debugging to be short
may there be many summer mornings
when you'll enter with pleasure, with joy,
the repos you've seen for the first time

Stop in Python forum sites
and get the good tips
libraries and patterns, data structures and functions,
and strong typing of every kind
as many type hints as you can

Go to many StackOverflow posts
to study and learn from the educated ones
keep Python always in your mind
your arrival there is your destiny

But don't rush the debugging at all
it better lasts for many years,
and then when you're old to stay on a conference,
wealthy with all you've gained on the way
without expecting Python to make you rich.

Python gave you the beautiful exceptions.
without her you wouldn't have set out
there's nothing else to give you anymore

And if you find her poor, Python hasn't fooled you.
now that you became wise with so much experience
you should have already understood what Pythons mean
